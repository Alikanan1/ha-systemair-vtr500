## Features

*   **Full Mode Control:** Manage all modes like Auto, Manual (Low, Normal, High), Party, Boost, Away, Holiday, and Stop.
*   **Detailed Sensors:** Read data for temperatures, humidity, fan speeds, heat recovery, and alarms.
*   **Thermostat Control:** Functions as a thermostat to adjust the desired supply air temperature.
*   **Advanced Automation:** Uses Node-RED to automatically adjust fan speed based on humidity and CO2 levels, including a night setback feature.
*   **Custom UI:** A functional Lovelace dashboard built with `custom:button-card` and Mushroom Cards.
*   **Alarm Monitoring:** Displays the status of A, B, C, and filter alarms.

## 2. Installation and Configuration

A step-by-step guide to take you from physical installation to a fully automated system.

### Step 2.1: Physical Installation of the Elfin EW11

> **WARNING:** Always disconnect the power to the ventilation unit before opening it. If you are uncertain, consult an electrician.

1.  **Locate the Modbus and Power Port:** On the main board of the VTR-500, find the terminal for external communication, marked `A(+)`, `B(-)`, `24V`, and `GND`.

2.  **Connect the Elfin EW11:** Wire the connections as shown in the diagram below.

3.  **Restore Power:** Once everything is securely connected, turn the power back on.

### Step 2.2: Configure the Elfin EW11

1.  **Connect to the EW11's Network:** Connect to its Wi-Fi network `EW1x_...` (no password required).
2.  **Open the Web UI:** Go to `http://10.10.100.254`. Log in with `admin` / `admin`.
3.  **Connect to Your Wi-Fi:** Under "System Settings" -> "WiFi Settings", set "Wifi Mode" to "STA", find your home network, enter the password, and save.

4.  **Restart and Find New IP:** The device will restart. Find its new IP address (check your router's DHCP list) and set a static IP for it.
5.  **Configure Serial Port:** Log in to the new IP address. Go to "Serial Port Settings" and apply the settings shown below.

6.  **Configure Communication:** Go to "Communication Settings" and add a new profile as shown below.
    ![Communication Settings EW11](image/communication%20settings%20EW11.png)
7.  **Verify:** Go to the "Status" page. The data packet counters should now be increasing, confirming that communication is working.

### Step 2.3: Home Assistant Configuration

1.  **Enable Packages:** Ensure your `configuration.yaml` contains:
    ```yaml
    homeassistant:
      packages: !include_dir_named packages
    ```
2.  **Add the Configuration:** Place the `systemair.yaml` file from this repository into your `/config/packages/` directory.
3.  **Update IP Address:** Open `systemair.yaml` and change the `host` to the static IP address of your Elfin EW11.
4.  **Restart Home Assistant.**

### Step 2.4: Set up the Lovelace Dashboard

The configuration is split into three files. You need to add **three separate "Manual" cards** to your dashboard.

**How-to:**

1.  Navigate to your dashboard and select **"Edit Dashboard"**.
2.  Click **"+ ADD CARD"**, and choose the **"Manual"** card type.
3.  Repeat the process for each of the files below, copying the content from each file into a new "Manual" card.
    *   **Card 1:** `Custom button-card.yaml` (Main control panel)
    *   **Card 2:** `thermostat.yaml` (Thermostat control)
    *   **Card 3:** `type entities.yaml` (Sensor entities)
4.  Save each card and arrange them as you like.

### Step 2.5: Import the Node-RED Flow

1.  Open Node-RED, go to Menu -> Import, and paste the content from `flows.json`.
2.  **IMPORTANT:** Review the new nodes and update the `entity_id`s to match your own humidity and CO2 sensors.
3.  Click "Deploy".

### Bonus: How the Night Setback Works

The Node-RED flow includes a night setback logic to save energy and reduce noise. When activated, it lowers the target temperature by ~3¬∞C and sets the fan speed to "Low".

**Important:** This feature does not activate on its own. It is controlled by a `switch` entity in Home Assistant named `switch.nattsenking_ventilasjon_pa`.

To use it, you must create your own automation or script to turn this switch on. Examples:
*   **Via voice assistant:** "Hey Google, activate night mode".
*   **Via a Home Assistant automation:** Turn the switch on at a fixed time.
*   **Via a button on your dashboard.**

The automation will automatically restore normal operation at **04:00 on weekdays** and **06:00 on weekends**.
